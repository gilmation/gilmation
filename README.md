#### Hi, my name is [Hugh Gilmour](https://github.com/shugster13) and I was developing software as Gilmation from 2009 until 2019.

In this account there are some public projects that contain some simple tools that were developed by me for[Gilmation](https://gilmation.com).  

* [IP](https://github.com/gilmation/ip) is a simple Sinatra App that returns the IP address of the request origin which can be useful for automated whitelist updating (if you are traveling or working out of different offices). The endpoints are avialable at ip.gilmation.com

* [Gilmation](https://github.com/gilmation/gilmation-static) is a simple Jekyll static site with a bit of [Ruby to make working with AWS Cloudfront distributions and invalidations from the CLI a bit more pleasant](https://github.com/gilmation/gilmation-static/blob/main/cloudfront.rb).

* [Gilmation Tools](https://github.com/gilmation/gilmation-tools) contains a lot of old script and other utilities but the thor directory particularly the 
json.thor and the time.thor files.



The private projects are all work that is used by or has been sold to clients. If you'd like to see more please [reach out to me](https://gilmation.com/contact).

#### Hi, my name is [Hugh Gilmour](https://github.com/shugster13) and I was developing software as Gilmation from 2009 until 2019.

In this account there are some public projects that contain some simple tools that were developed by me for[Gilmation](https://gilmation.com).  Up until recently I did all of my work on github under the gilmation account but I have now created [a new personal account](https://github.com/shugster13) and will add a few personal projects over the next few weeks.

* [IP](https://github.com/gilmation/ip) is a simple Sinatra App that returns the IP address of the request origin which can be useful for automated whitelist updating (if you are traveling or working out of different offices). The endpoints are avialable at ip.gilmation.com

* [Gilmation](https://github.com/gilmation/gilmation-static) is a simple Jekyll static site with a bit of [Ruby to make working with AWS Cloudfront distributions and invalidations from the CLI a bit more pleasant](https://github.com/gilmation/gilmation-static/blob/main/cloudfront.rb).

* [Gilmation Tools](https://github.com/gilmation/gilmation-tools) contains a lot of useful scripts (for checking urls, redirects, ssl certs and processing data) and other utilities.  I'm in the process of unifying older projects into this single repo but revewing the code to make sure nothing is being exposed that shouldn't is taking a wee bit of time. On the way are more scripts (mostly ruby, some node) and some infrasctucture related directories (packer, terraform and vagrant).

There are also a fair few private projects are all work that is used by or has been sold to clients. If you'd like to see more please [let me know](https://gilmation.com/contact).
